Subject: Inappropriate use of time on Google Doodle games

Coworkers,

It has come to my attention that many in the office have been spending time on the Google home page microgames. This memo is a reminder to use your work hours for work.

According to a recent article, the estimated daily cost of people collectively playing these games instead of working is over $120 million—which is calculated based on the daily average increased time spent on the Google home page (36 seconds).

If these estimates are applied to our 600 office employees, this results in a nearly $700 weekly loss.

This is a conservative estimate considering the extensive discussions that occur about beating the office's current high score. The extra cost quickly adds up.

Of course, we don't want you to view our organization as a place of drudgery and draconian rules. I encourage a fun and competitive environment, and I recognize that we certainly won't be profitable if you are unhappy or dissatisfied with your jobs. This is just a reminder to be careful with your use of company time.

Thank you,

The Manager

Subject: Attaching cover sheets to TPS reports

This is to remind the division that, starting today, we are now filing all Testing Procedure Specification (TPS) reports with new cover sheets.

The reason for this change is simple. In addition to a new format, the cover sheets provide a summary of the report as well as the updated legal copy. The new cover sheets also include Initech's new logo.

Though this change may initially seem like a headache and an extra step, it is necessary to include the new cover sheets due to their updated information. Failing to do so will result in a confusing and inaccurate product being delivered to our customers.

Please be sure to follow this new procedure.

Best regards,

Vice President Lumbergh

Subject: Update to this week's assignment

Dear Students,

This is to let you know there is a mistake in the reading list for this week.

The literature list you all received is from last year and is outdated. We have since made changes, and these changes are outlined below.

Instead of reading Chapters 1–3 of The Science of Psychology, and Chapters 6–8 of Neurobiology, read Chapters 2–3 of The Science of Psychology and Chapters 5–8 of Neurobiology.

Please be sure to follow these new instructions.

Best regards,

Professor Jenkins

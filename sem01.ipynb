    "#### Задача 1 (10 баллов). \n",
    "\n",
    "Представим себе, что мы хотим открыть музыкальный магазин и заведовать всеми его делами. Напишем программу, которая будет визуализировать наши мечты. Наверное, в первую очередь нам понадобится класс для самого магазина. У магазина есть счет, склад, возможность продавать инструменты и покупать их (может быть, что-то еще - что придумаете). Потом, нужен, конечно, класс для музыкального инструмента. Попробуйте реализовать музыкальные инструменты с помощью наследования: можно создать некий абстрактный класс \"инструмент\", а от него будут наследовать классы \"гитара\", \"пианино\" и так далее - при этом у гитар и пианино могут быть свои разные характеристики, н-р, у гитары количество струн, тип порожка и так далее. Можно и более подробную иерархию, если будете успевать (например, инструменты бывают электрическими и акустическими). Наконец, можно создать класс \"покупатель\", у которого будет кошелек. \n",
    "\n",
    "Наконец, неплохо бы не забыть написать некий код, который будет приводить наши классы в движение: имитировать рабочий день магазина (можно в цикле), с рандомной вероятностью посещение покупателей, давать нашему владельцу-пользователю возможность решить, не пора ли закупить новые инструменты или, может быть, затеять рекламную кампанию. \n",

    "Фантазия всячески поощряется, могу за нее поставить дополнительные баллы. "
